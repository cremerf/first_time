# hello-world

> this is my first interaction with GitHub for about months I think. I look forward to share with this community lots of proyects and useful information.
**I'm trying to get used to github, I have already used it in the past , it's my first exercise here, I created a new branch I'll try to "merge" it to the Main** 
**I'll share with you my DataCamp profile, I've been studying there since this past January**
